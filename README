** flexemu, a FLEX emulator with full graphics display **
*********************************************************

This is an emulator for the FLEX operating system based on an MC6809
microprocessor emulator.

For compiling and installing look at INSTALL.
For compiling on Windows95/98/WindowsNT look at INSTALL.NT.

* Motivation for this project *
*******************************

Very long time ago I've got an Eurocom II computer mainly distributed in
Germany with an MC6809 Processor rated at 1.33 MHz. Also FLEX Operating
system was supported. It was at the time of Apple II and CP/M computers.

A very nice feature of this computer was it's graphics resolution. It supported
512 x 256 pixel of up to 6 bit planes. The complete graphics controller
consisted of standard 74xxx TTL cirquits. Drawing caracters on the display
was just a special case of drawing graphics. It is handled in the Monitor EPROM.
So each character was drawn pixel by pixel by the processor.

At this time I've learned a lot about assembler and Basic programming but also
on understanding the hardware.

I still have all this stuff and thought it would be nice to preserve the taste
of this computer, it's processor and the Operating system as an example of the
very beginning of the microcomputer area. It's completely written in ANSI C++
so having a good chance to keep it up for the next few years.

I've done some researches on the Internet for 6809 emulation and wrote a
little prototype for simulating the graphics display. I've found a ready-to-use
processor emulation by Ray Bellis but after the implementation of the prototype
it's performance on a Linux box with an 486/DX2 66 was very poor. (I updated
the video display after any change in video RAM which produced a heavy load
on X11 protocol).

Some times later during testing a Commodore C64 emulator I was inspired on the
implementation of their graphics display. The processor emulation and the 
update of the graphics display was strictly synchronized. For example every
n processor cyles a line of the graphics display was updated. So I made
another effort improving my prototype with much more success.

The rest of the project was lots of hours of busy work implementing all
the hardware components, implementing the graphics display with X11 (first
using XLib and in a second version using XToolkit with Athena widgets),
improving the performance and fixing some minor bugs of the MC6809 which I've
got from Ray Bellis, and transfering of programs from the original system to
a linux box. Now the project has even been ported to Windows95/WindowsNT.

A second Executable, FLEXplorer, is similar to an Explorer and can be used
to explore DSK-, FLX- and directory FLEX file containers.

For advanced user support a third Executable, FSetup is available. It's
simply a Dialog for editing the most important options needed for running
flexemu.

As the result I hope You will have lots of fun with a full functional FLEX
emulator with lots of nice features like:

R. P. Bellis (Ray.Bellis@psy.ox.ac.uk) on which the mc6809 emulator is based on
	I used it's latest version usim-0.91 (sorry for sacrificing the
	original code but I had to do it for performance reasons). If You
	want to use a well structured and conscientious implemented mc6809
	emulator better look at usim.  It can be downloaded from:
	ftp://ftp.mrc-bbc.ox.ac.uk/pub/users/rpb/mc6809/usim-0.91.tar.gz

Lennart Benschop (benschop@ics.ele.tue.nl) on which the second mc6809 emulation
	is based on. He has written a complete mc6809 emulation in ONE
	C function. It's a hard work for the compiler to translate it.
	Excellent work!
	His emulator is accessible on ftp.eb.ele.tue.nl/pub/users/benschop.

Didier Derny (didier@aida.remcomp.fr) on which the mc6809 disassembler is based
	on

Alan Dekok (http://www.sandelman.ocunix.on.ca/People/Alan_DeKok/interests/6809.html)
	for giving lots of informations about mc6809

Ben Williams (bwilliams@blackbelt.com) for it's researches on copyrights of FLEX
	(He has written a FLEX emulator too. Look at:
	http://www.blackbelt.com/blackbelt/flexem.html)

Eltec Elektronik (http://www.eltec.de) which has developed the hardware on which
	the emulator is based on, and gave me the OK for shipping the full
	screen editor e.cmd

The wxWindows dev. team (http://www.wxWindows.org) developping a platform
	independent GUI API.
