********************************************
* Compiling/Install flexemu on Unix/Linux  *
********************************************

Flexemu supports configure scripts. So there are three steps to compile and
install it:

        - export QT_SELECT=qt5
	- ./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
	- make
	- sudo make install

prerequisites:

        On a debian based system (Debian / Ubuntu / Linux Mint / Raspbian)
        install the following deb-packages:

        sudo apt-get install build-essential qtbase5-dev qtbase5-dev-tools libqt5core5a libqt5gui5 libqt5widgets5 libqt5x11extras5-dev

remarks:

        - When using configure with --prefix=/usr flexemu also get's
          integrated into the desktop and appears in the System menu
          category, Emulator sub category. If --prefix is not specified
          the default prefix is /usr/local. For this prefix desktop or
          icon files may not be correctly integrated into the desktop.
          This has been exprienced with Linux Mint. It may behave
          differently for other Linux distributions.
	- If You don't want native file system support comment out
	  NAFS switch in src/config.h
	- If You don't want the disassembler to substitute some FLEX jump
	  vectors to print as labels comment out FLEX_LABEL switch in
	  config.h.
	- There are two MC6809 processor implementations. One of them is
	  about 20% slower but a very well structured implementation. Each
	  instruction is executed in it's own function. So it can easily be
	  debuged with gdb. The processor cycles are exactly calculated.
	  The second is faster, the complete processor is emulated in one
	  inline-function. The processor cycles are only aproximated
	  (4.8 cycles for each instruction). The faster processor can
	  be compiled with switch FASTFLEX uncommented in config.h.
        - There are post installation steps executed to provide desktop
          icons and adding mime types for support of *.dsk, *.flx and *.wta
          files. If they do not work as expected they can be disabled with
          the configure option --disable-post-install
          The post installation steps are (assuming --prefix=/usr):

             gtk-update-icon-cache /usr/share/icons/hicolor
             update-mime-database /usr/share/mime
             update-desktop-database /usr/share/applications
