* Compiling/Install flexemu on Unix/Linux  *
********************************************

Flexemu supports configure scripts. So there are three steps to install it:

	- ./configure --with-app-defaults=auto
	- make
	- sudo make install

remarks:

	- --with-app-defaults=auto parameter makes the best guess
          for installing the X11 application defaults file.
          If this parameter is not present the default path 
          EPREFIX/lib/X11/app-defaults is used (which usually does not
          fit).
          To compile flexplorer you first have to install GTK.
	  (http://www.gtk.org/) and wxWindows for GTK and compile
	  static or shared libs. (http://www.wxWindows.com/)
	- If You don't want native file system support comment out
	  NAFS switch in src/config.h
	- If You don't want the disassembler to substitute some FLEX jump
	  vectors to print as labels comment out FLEX_LABEL switch in
	  config.h.
	- There are two MC6809 processor implementations. One of them is
	  about 20% slower but a very well structured implementation. Each
	  instruction is executed in it's own function. So it can easily be
	  debuged with gdb. The processor cycles are exactly calculated.
	  The second is faster, the complete processor is emulated in one
	  inline-function. The processor cycles are only aproximated
	  (4.8 cycles for each instruction). The faster processor can
	  be compiled with switch FASTFLEX uncommented in config.h.
