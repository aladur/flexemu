* Compiling/Install flexemu on Unix/Linux  *
********************************************

Flexemu supports configure scripts. So there are three steps to compile and
install it:

	- ./configure --with-app-defaults=auto --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc
	- make
	- sudo make install

prerequisites:

        On a debian based system (Debian / Ubuntu / Linux Mint / Raspbian)
        install the following deb-packages:

        sudo apt-get install libxt-dev libxaw7-dev lixwxgtk3.0-dev

remarks:

        - When using --prefix=/usr flexemu also get's integrated into the
          desktop and appears in the Games menu category, Emulator sub
          category. If --prefix is not specified the default prefix is
          /usr/local. For this prefix desktop or icon files may not be
          correctly integrated into the desktop. This has been exprienced
          with Linux Mint. It may behave differently for other Linux
          distributions.
	- --with-app-defaults=auto parameter makes the best guess
          for installing the X11 application defaults file.
          If this parameter is not present the default path 
          EPREFIX/lib/X11/app-defaults is used (which usually does not
          fit).
          To compile flexplorer you first have to install GTK.
	  (http://www.gtk.org/) and wxWindows for GTK and compile
	  static or shared libs. (http://www.wxWindows.com/)
	- If You don't want native file system support comment out
	  NAFS switch in src/config.h
	- If You don't want the disassembler to substitute some FLEX jump
	  vectors to print as labels comment out FLEX_LABEL switch in
	  config.h.
	- There are two MC6809 processor implementations. One of them is
	  about 20% slower but a very well structured implementation. Each
	  instruction is executed in it's own function. So it can easily be
	  debuged with gdb. The processor cycles are exactly calculated.
	  The second is faster, the complete processor is emulated in one
	  inline-function. The processor cycles are only aproximated
	  (4.8 cycles for each instruction). The faster processor can
	  be compiled with switch FASTFLEX uncommented in config.h.

* Compiling/Install flexemu on Windows *
****************************************

For Windows there is a ready-to-use installation executable available. See
flexemu homepage for details: https://aladur.neocities.org/flexemu/

For Microsoft Visual Studio (15 or higher) there is a solution flexemu.sln
available.

To compile and creating an installation there are bash scripts available
in directory build/windows. You can use e.g. git bash to execute these scripts.
curl has to be available within the bash script. It can be downloaded from:
https://curl.haxx.se/download.html

1. download_and_rebuild_libs.sh

        It downloads and rebuilds all dependent libraries (wxWidgets).

2. rebuild_flexemu_all_and_copy_libs.sh

        It makes a full rebuild in all configurations and copies the dependent
        libraries into the target directories.

3. create_installer.sh

        It creates a flexemu installer executable. It automatically downloads
        the Visual C/C++ redistributable packages. Before doing this the NSIS
        windows installer has to be downloaded from:
        http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download
