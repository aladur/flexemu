flexfs - File systems supported by flexemu
<hr></h2>
<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
Flexemu supports three different file systems:
<p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="#dsk_format">Disk image created by Ben Williams (DSK-format)</a>
 <li><a href="#ws_format">Disk image created by Wolfgang Schwotzer</a>
 <li><a href="#nafs_format">Native file system support (all files in a directory)</a>
</ul>
<dl>
<a name="dsk_format">
<dt><b>Disk image created by Ben Williams (DSK-format)
</b><p><dd>
<a href="http://www.blackbelt.com/blackbelt/flexem.html">
Ben Williams has written a FLEX emulator</a>
too.
The complete disk is contained in one file. A wide range of track/sector
combinations is supported: <b>2 <= tracks <= 255 and 6 <= sectors <= 255</b>.
Following map shows some typical track/sector combinations:
<p>
<table border>
 <tr><th>filesize [Byte]</th><th>tracks</th><th>sectors</th>
 <tr><th>89600</th><th>35</th><th>10</th>
 <tr><th>179000</th><th>35</th><th>20</th>
 <tr><th>358400</th><th>35</th><th>40</th>
 <tr><th>102400</th><th>40</th><th>10</th>
 <tr><th>204800</th><th>40</th><th>20</th>
 <tr><th>409600</th><th>40</th><th>40</th>
 <tr><th>(204800</th><th>80</th><th>10)</th>
 <tr><th>(409600</th><th>80</th><th>20)</th>
 <tr><th>819200</th><th>80</th><th>40</th>
</table>
<p>
Each sector contains 256 Byte. There is no file header. The size of the file
can simply be computed with &lt;nr_of_tracks&gt; x &lt;nr_of_sectors&gt; x 256 Byte. If
the DSK-file is write protected the drive within flexemu is write protected too.

The complete disk is contained in one file. All the information about how
many tracks and sectors are discribed in a fileheader:
<p>
<table border>
 <tr><th>bytes</th><th>name</th><th>description</th>
 <tr><align=left><td>4</td><td>magic_number</td><td>always 0x485C9A33</td>
 <tr><align=left><td>1</td><td>write_protect</td><td>flag for write protection</td>
 <tr><align=left><td>1</td><td>sizecode</td><td>128 * 2 ^ n Bytes/sector</td>
 <tr><align=left><td>1</td><td>sides0</td><td>nr of sides on track 0</td>
 <tr><align=left><td>1</td><td>sectors0</td><td>nr of sect. on track 0</td>
 <tr><align=left><td>1</td><td>sides</td><td>nr of sides on track != 0</td>
 <tr><align=left><td>1</td><td>sectors</td><td>nr of sect. on track != 0</td>
 <tr><align=left><td>1</td><td>tracks</td><td>nr of tracks total</td>
 <tr><align=left><td>5</td><td>dummy1 - dummy 5</td><td>for stuffing</td>
</table>
<p>
The format of the file header can be changed for future improvements. For the
actual format look at
<b>struct s_flex_header
</b>in the header file
<b>e2floppy.h</b>.
<a name="nafs_format">
<p><dt><b>NAtive File System support (nafs)
</b><p><dd>
A directory will be made visible as a disk drive from within flexemu.
So each file in the directory will be visible as a file contained on the disk.
Random files are identified by the user execute bit (on Unix) or the hidden bit
(Win32) of the corresponding file set.
<p>
The system info sectors and directory sectors are managed by flexemu and
are not accessible as file. The boot sector (track 0/sector 1) is contained
in the file
<b>boot.
</b>If there is no such file the disk can't be booted. The link
to flex.sys will be generated dynamically by flexemu. The user does not have
to input any link command.
<p>
<dt>There are some restrictions the user should be aware of:
<dd>
</dl>
<p>
<ul>
 <li>A nafs drive always contains 80 tracks and 36 sectors. If the size of
all files in the directory won't fit some of them are not visible from within
flexemu.
 <li>All filenames must conform to FLEX file naming conventions otherwise
they can't be seen.
 <li>A nafs drive is only accessible by propper fms calls. Direct
reading/writing sectors is not supported.
 <li>New files have a name tmpXX (XX = two digit number) and are
renamed to their real name after closing them. So if there are any files
with that name anything goes wrong with the file creation.
 <li>If the directory of a nafs drive is full it will be extended
automatically. So no directory extend utility needs to be used.
<p>
There is a utility to dynamically
<a href="flexutil.htm#mount">mount</a>,
update,
<a href="flexutil.htm#info">give info</a>
or
<a href="flexutil.htm#umount">umount</a>
a nafs
drive.
