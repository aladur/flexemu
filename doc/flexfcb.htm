flexfcb - FLEX File Control Block (FCB)
<hr></h2>
<h2>GENERAL DESCRIPTION</h2>
The
<b>File Control Block (FCB)
</b>is the heart of the FLEX File Management System (FMS). An FCB is a 320 byte long
block of RAM, in the user's program area, which is used by programs to
communicate with FMS. A separate FCB is needed for each open file. After a
file has been closed, the FCB may be re-used to open another file or to perform
some other disk function such as Delete or Rename. An FCB may be placed
anywhere in the user's program area (except page 0) that the programmer wishes.
The memory reserved for use as an FCB need not be preset or initialized in any
way. Only the parameters necessary to perform the function need be stored in 
the FCB; the File Management System will initialize those areas of the FCB
needed for it's use.
<h2>DESCRIPTION OF AN FCB</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b>Byte 0: Function Code
</b><dd>
The desired function code must be stored in this byte by the user before
calling FMS to process the FCB. See
<a href="flexfms.htm"> FLEX File Management System</a>.
</b><dt><b>Byte 1: Error Status Byte
</b><dd>
If an error was detected during the processing of a function, FMS stores the
error number in this byte and returns to the user with the CPU Z-Condition Code
bit clear, i. e. a non-zero condition exists. This may be tested by the BEQ
instruction.
<dt><b>Byte 2: Activity Status
</b><dd>
This byte is set by FMS to a "1" if the file is open for read, or "2" if the
file is open for writing. This byte is checked by several FMS function
processors to determine if the requested operation is legal. A Status Error
is returned for illegal operations.
</dl>
<p>
The next 12 bytes (3-14) comprise the "File Specification" of the file being
referenced by the FCB. A "File Specification" consists of a drive number,
file name, and file extension. Some of the FMS functions do not require the
file name or extension. See the documentation of the individual function codes
for details.
<dl>
<dt><b>Byte 3: Drive Number
</b><dd>
This is the hardware drive number whose diskette contains the file being
referenced. It should be binary 0 to 3.
<dt><b>Bytes 4-11: File Name
</b><dd>
This is the name of the file being referenced. The name must start with a
letter and contain only letters, digits, hyphens and/or underscores. If the
name is less than 8 characters long, the remaining bytes must be zero. The name
should be left adjusted in its field.
<dt><b>Bytes 12-14: Extension
</b><dd>
This is the extension of the file name for the file being referenced. It must
start with a letter and contain only letters , digits, hyphens and/or
underscores. If the extension is less than 3 characters long, the remaining
bytes must be zero. The extension should be left adjusted. Files with null
extensions should not be created.
<dt><b>Byte 15: File Attributes
</b><dd>
At present, only the most significant 4 bits are defined in this byte. These
bits are used for the protection status bits and are assigned as follows:
<p>
<table border>
<tr><th>BIT 7</th><th>Write Protect</th>
<tr><th>BIT 6</th><th>Delete Protect</th>
<tr><th>BIT 5</th><th>Read Protect</th>
<tr><th>BIT 4</th><th>Catalog Protect</th>
</table>
<p>
Setting these bits to 1 will activate the appropriate protection status. All
undefined bits of this byte should remain 0!
<dt><b>Byte 16: Reserved for future system use
</b><dd>
<dt><b>Bytes 17-18: Starting disk address of the file
</b><dd>
These two bytes contain the hardware track and sector numbers, respectively,
of the first sector of the file.
<dt><b>Bytes 19-20: Ending disk address of the file
</b><dd>
These two bytes contain the hardware track and sector numbers, respectively,
of the last sector of the file.
<dt><b>Bytes 21-22: File size
</b><dd>
This is a 16-bit number indicating the number of sectors in the file.
<dt><b>Byte 23: File Sector Map Indicator
</b><dd>
If this byte is non-zero (usually $02), the file has been created as a random
access file and contains a File Sector Map. See the description of Random Files
for details.
<dt><b>Byte 24: Reserved for future system use
</b><dd>
<dt><b>Bytes 25-27: File Creation Date
</b><dd>
These three bytes contain the binary date of the files creation. The first byte
is the month, the second is the day, and the third is the year (only the tens
of ones digits).
<dt><b>Bytes 28-29 FCB List Pointer
</b><dd>
All FCBs which are open for reading or writing are chained together. These two
bytes contain the memory address of the FCB List Pointer of the next FCB in the
chain. These bytes are zero if this FCB is the last FCB in the chain. The first
FCB in the chain is pointed to by the FCB Base Pointer. (See
<a href="flexmem.htm"> FLEX Memory Map</a>
). <dt><b>Bytes 30-31: Current Position
</b><dd>
These bytes contain the hardware track and sector numbers, respectively, of the
sector currently in the sector buffer portion of the FCB. If the file is being
written, the sector to which these bytes point has not yet been written to the
diskette; it is still in the buffer.
<dt><b>Bytes 32-33: Current Record Number
</b><dd>
These bytes contain the current logical Record Number of the sector in the
FCB buffer.
<dt><b>Bytes 34: Data Index
</b><dd>
This byte contains the address of the next data byte to be fetched from (if
reading) or stored to (if writing) the sector buffer. This address is relative
to the beginning of the sector, and is advanced automatically by the Read/Write
Next Byte function (see
<a href="flexfms.htm"> FLEX File Management System</a>.
). The user program has no need to manipulate this byte.
<dt><b>Byte 35: Random Index
</b><dd>
This byte is used in conjunction with the
<b>Get Random Byte From Sector
</b>function (see
<a href="flexfms.htm"> FLEX File Management System</a>.
) to read a specific byte from the sector buffer without having to sequentially
skip over any intervening bytes. The address of the desired byte, relative to
the beginning of the sector, is stored in
<b>Random Index
</b>by the user, and the
<b>Get Random Byte From Sector
</b>function is issued to FMS. The specified data byte will be returned in the
A-register. A value less than 4 will access one of the linkage bytes in the
sector. User data starts at an index of 4.
<dt><b>Bytes 36-46: Name Work Buffer
</b><dd>
These bytes are used internally by FMS as temporary storage for a file name.
These locations are not for use by a user program.
<dt><b>Bytes 47-49: Current Directory Address
</b><dd>
If the FCB is being used to process directory information with the
<b>Get/Put Information Record
</b>functions, (see
<a href="flexfms.htm"> FLEX File Management System</a>.
), these three bytes contain the track number, sector number, and starting
data index of the directory entry whose content is in the Directory Information
portion of the FCB. The values in these three bytes are updated automatically
by the
<b>Get Information Record
</b>function.
<dt><b>Bytes 50-52: First Deleted Directory Pointer
</b><dd>
These bytes are used internally by FMS when looking for a free entry in the
directory to which to assign the name of a new file.
<dt><b>Bytes 53-63: Scratch Bytes
</b><dd>
These are the bytes into which the user stores the new name and extension of
a file being renamed. The new name is formatted the same as described above
under
<b>File Name
</b>and
<b>File Extension.
</b><dt><b>Byte 59: Space Compression Flag
</b><dd>
If a file is open for read or write, this byte indicates if space compression
is being performed. A value of zero indicates that space compression is to be
done when reading or writing the data. This is the vlaue that is stored by
<b>the Open For Read
</b>and
<b>Open For Write
</b>(see
<a href="flexfms.htm"> FLEX File Management System</a>.
)
functions. A value of $FF indicates that no space compression is to be done.
This value is what the user must store in this byte, after opening the file,
if space compression is not desired. (Such as for binary files). A positive
non-zero value in this byte indicates that space compression is currently in
progress; the value being a count of the number of spaces processed thus far.
(Note that although this byte overlaps the
<b>Scratch Bytes
</b>described above, there is no conflict since the
<b>Space Compression Flag
</b>is used only when a file is open, and the
<b>Scratch Bytes
</b>are used only by
<b>Rename
</b>, which requires that the file be closed). In general, this byte should be 0
while working with text type files, and $FF for binary files.
<dt><b>Bytes 64-319: Sector Buffer
</b><dd>
These bytes contain the data contained in the sector being read or written.
The first four bytes of the sector are used by the system. The remaining 252
are used for data storage.
