<dt><b>5 - SYSTEM DIRECTORY ERROR - REBOOT SYSTEM
</b><dd>
Reserved for future system use.<tt> </tt>
<dt><b>6 - THE SYSTEM DIRECTORY SPACE IS FULL

<dt><b>10 - DISK FILE WRITE ERROR
</b><dd>
A checksum error was detected by the hardware in attempting to write a sector.<tt> </tt>
DOS has already tried several times, without success, to re-write the failing

be returned if a read error was detected by DOS in attempting to update the
diskette directory
<dt><b>11 - THE FILE OR DISK IS WRITE PROTECTED
</b><dd>

use of the write-enable cutout in the diskette or to a file which has the
write protect bit set.<tt> </tt>

</b><dd>
Reserved for future system use.<tt> </tt>
<dt><b>18 - SYSTEM FILE STATUS ERROR
