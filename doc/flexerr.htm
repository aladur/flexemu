<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<div class="options-list">
<dl>
<dt>1 - ILLEGAL FMS FUNCTION CODE ENCOUNTERED</dt>
<dd>
FMS was called with a function code in the Function Code byte of the FCB that
was too large or illegal.
</dd>
<dt>2 - THE REQUESTED FILE IS IN USE</dt>
<dd>
An Open for Read, Update, or Write function was issued on an FCB that is
already open.
</dd>
<dt>3 - THE FILE SPECIFIED ALREADY EXISTS</dt>
<dd>
a. An Open For Write was issued on an FCB containing the specification for a
file already existing in the diskette directory.
<br>
b. A Rename function was issued specifying a new name that was the same as the
name of a file already existing in the diskette directory.
</dd>
<dt>4 - THE SPECIFIED FILE COULD NOT BE FOUND</dt>
<dd>
An open for Read or Update, a Rename, or a Delete function was requested on
an FCB containing the file specification for a file which does not exist in
the diskette directory
</dd>
<dt>5 - SYSTEM DIRECTORY ERROR - REBOOT SYSTEM</dt>
<dd>
Reserved for future system use.
</dd>
<dt>6 - THE SYSTEM DIRECTORY SPACE IS FULL</dt>
<dd>
This error should never occur since the directory space is self expanding, and
can never be filled. Only disk space can be filled (error #7).
</dd>
<dt>7 - ALL AVAILABLE DISK SPACE HAS BEEN USED</dt>
<dd>
All of the available space on the diskette has been used up by files. If this
error is returned by FMS, the last character sent to be written to a file did
not actually get written.
</dd>
<dt>8 - READ PAST END OF FILE</dt>
<dd>
A read operation on a file encountered an end-of-file. All of the data in the
file has been processed. This error will also be returned when reading a
directory whth the Get Information Record function when the end of directory
is reached.
</dd>
<dt>9 - DISK FILE READ ERROR</dt>
<dd>
A checksum error was encountered by the hardware in attempting to read a
sector. DOS has already attempted to re-read the failing sector several times,
without success, before reporting the error. This error may also result from
illegal track and sector addresses being put in the FCB.
</dd>
<dt>10 - DISK FILE WRITE ERROR</dt>
<dd>
A checksum error was detected by the hardware in attempting to write a sector.
DOS has already tried several times, without success, to re-write the failing
sector before reporting the error. This error may also result from illegal
track and sector numbers being put in the FCB. A write-error status may also
be returned if a read error was detected by DOS in attempting to update the
diskette directory
</dd>
<dt>11 - THE FILE OR DISK IS WRITE PROTECTED</dt>
<dd>
An attempt was made to write on a diskette which has been write-protected by
use of the write-enable cutout in the diskette or to a file which has the
write protect bit set.
</dd>
<dt>12 - THE FILE IS PROTECTED - FILE NOT DELETED</dt>
<dd>
The file attempted to be deleted has its delete protect bit set and can not be
deleted.
</dd>
<dt>13 - ILLEGAL FILE CONTROL BLOCK SPECIFIED</dt>
<dd>
An attempt was made to access an FCB from the open FCB chain, but it was not
in the chain.
</dd>
<dt>14 - ILLEGAL DISK ADDRESS ENCOUNTERED</dt>
<dd>
Reserved for future system use.
</dd>
<dt>15 - AN ILLEGAL DRIVE NUMBER WAS SPECIFIED</dt>
<dd>
Reserved for future system use.
</dd>
<dt>16 - DRIVES NOT READY</dt>
<dd>
The drive does not have a diskette in it or the door is open. This message
cannot be issued for mini floppys since there is no means of detecting such
a state.
</dd>
<dt>17 - THE FILE IS PROTECTED - ACCESS DENIED</dt>
<dd>
Reserved for future system use.
</dd>
<dt>18 - SYSTEM FILE STATUS ERROR</dt>
<dd>
a. A read or Rewind was attempted on a file which was closed, or open for
write access.
<br>
b. A write was attempted on a file which was closed, or open for read access.
</dd>
<dt>19 - FMS DATA INDEX RANGE ERROR</dt>
<dd>
The Get Random Byte from Sector function was issued with a Random Byte nuber
greater than 256
</dd>
<dt>20 - FMS INACTIVE - REBOOT SYSTEM</dt>
<dd>
Reserved for future system use.
</dd>
<dt>21 - ILLEGAL FILE SPECIFICATION</dt>
<dd>
A format error was detected in a file name specification. The name must begin
with a letter and contain only letters, digits, hyphens, and/or underscores.
Similarly with file extensions. File names are limited to 8 characters,
extensions to 3.
</dd>
<dt>22 - SYSTEM FILE CLOSE ERROR</dt>
<dd>
Reserved for future system use.
</dd>
<dt>23 - SECTOR MAP OVERFLOW - DISK TOO SEGMENTED</dt>
<dd>
An attempt was made to create a very large random access file on a disk which
is very segmented. All record information could not fit in the 2 sectors of
the File Sector Map. Recreating the file on a new diskette will solve the
problem
</dd>
<dt>24 - NON-EXISTENT RECORD NUMBER SPECIFIED</dt>
<dd>
A record number larger than the last record number of the file was specified
in a random position access.
</dd>
<dt>25 - RECORD NUMBER MATCH ERROR - FILE DAMAGED</dt>
<dd>
The record located by the FMS random search is not the correct record. The
file is probably damaged.
</dd>
<dt>26 - COMMAND SYNTAX ERROR - RETYPE COMMAND</dt>
<dd>
The command line just typed has a syntax error.
</dd>
<dt>27 - THAT COMMAND IS NOT ALLOWED WHILE PRINTING</dt>
<dd>
The command just entered is not allowed to operate while the system printer
spooler is activated.
</dd>
<dt>28 - WRONG HARDWARE CONFIGURATION</dt>
<dd>
This error usually implies insufficient memory installed in the computer
for a particular function or trying to use the printer spooler without the
hardware timer board installed.
</dd>
