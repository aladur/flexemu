<h1>flexmem - FLEX Memory Map</h1>
<hr>

<h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
<div class="justify">
The following is a description of those memory locations within the DOS
portion of FLEX which contain information of interest to the programmer.
The user is cautioned against utilization for his own purposes any
locations documented as being either "reserved" or "system scratch", as
this action may cause destruction of data.

<h2 id="fmsmem">FLEX FMS VARIABLE SYSTEM MEMORY MAP</h2>
<div class="options-list">
<dl>
<dt>$D409-$D40A FCB Base Pointer</dt>
<dd>
These locations contain the address of the
<a href="flexfcb.htm">FCB</a>
List Pointer bytes of the first
FCB in the chain of open files. The address in these locations is managed by
<a href="flexfms.htm">FMS</a>
and the programmer should not store any values in these locations. A user
program may, however, want to chain through the FCBs of the open files for 
some reason, and the address stored in these locations is the proper starting
point. Remember that the address is that of the FCB List Pointer locations
in the FCB, not the first word of the FCB. A value of zero in these locations
indicates that there are no open files.
</dd>
<dt>$D40B-$D40C Current FCB Address</dt>
<dd>
These locations contain the address of the last FCB processed by the File
Management System. The address is that of the first word of the FCB.
</dd>
<dt>$D435 Verify Flag</dt>
<dd>
A non-zero value in this location indicates that FMS will check each sector
written for errors immediately after writing it. A zero value indicates that
no error checking on writes is to be performed. The default value is
"non-zero". Flexemu does not support this feature.
</dd>

<div class="options-list">
<dl>
<dt>Line Buffer $C080-$C0FF</dt>
<dd>
The line buffer is a 128 byte area into which characters typed at the keyboard
are placed by the routine
<a href="flexdos.htm#inbuff">INBUFF</a>
. All characters entered from the keyboard are
placed in this buffer with the exception of control characters. Characters
which have been deleted by entering the backspace character do not appear in
the buffer, nor does the backspace character itself appear. The carriage
return signaling the end of the keyboard input is, however, put in the buffer.
This buffer is also used to hold the
<a href="flexuser.htm#startup">STARTUP</a> file during a cold start (boot)
operation. 
</dd>
<dt>TTYSET Backspace Character $CC00</dt>
<dd>
This is the character which the routine
<a href="flexdos.htm#inbuff">INBUFF</a>
will interpret as the
Backspace character. It is user definable through the
<a href="flexuser.htm#ttyset">TTYSET DOS Utility</a>.
Default = $08, a Ctrl-H (ASCII BS).
</dd>
<dt>TTYSET Delete $CC01</dt>
<dd>
This is the character which the routine
<a href="flexdos.htm#inbuff">INBUFF</a>
will interpret as the line
cancel or Delete character. It is user definable through the
<a href="flexuser.htm#ttyset">TTYSET DOS Utility</a>.
Default = $18, Ctrl-X (ASCII CAN).
</dd>
<dt>TTYSET End of Line Character $CC02</dt>
<dd>
This is the character DOS recognizes as the multiple command per line
separator. It is user definable through the
<a href="flexuser.htm#ttyset">TTYSET DOS Utility</a>.
Default=$3A,
a colon (:).
</dd>
<dt>TTYSET Depth Count $CC03</dt>
<dd>
This byte determines how many lines DOS will print on a page before Pausing
or issuing Ejects. It may be set by the user with the
<a href="flexuser.htm#ttyset">TTYSET DOS Utility</a>
command.
Default=0.
</dd>
<dt>TTYSET Width Count $CC04</dt>
<dd>
This byte tells DOS how many characters to output on each line. If zero,
there is no limit to the number output. This count may be set by the user
using
<a href="flexuser.htm#ttyset">TTYSET DOS Utility</a>.
Default=0.
</dd>
<dt>TTYSET Null Count $CC05</dt>
<dd>
This byte informs DOS if the number of null or pad characters to be
output after each carriage return, line feed pair. This count maybe
set using <a href="flexuser.htm#ttyset">TTYSET DOS Utility</a>.
Default=4.
</dd>
<dt>TTYSET Tab Character $CC06</dt>
<dd>
This byte defines a tab character which may be used by other
programs, such as the Editor. DOS itself does not make use of the
Tab character. Default=0, no tab character defined.
</dd>
<dt>TTYSET Backspace Echo Character $CC07</dt>
<dd>
This is the character the routine
<a href="flexdos.htm#inbuff">INBUFF</a>
will echo upon the receipt
of a backspace character. If the backspace echo character is set
to a $08, and the backspace character is also a $08, FLEX will
output a space ($20) prior to the outputting of the backspace echo
character. Default=0.
</dd>
<dt>TTYSET Eject Count $CC08</dt>
<dd>
The Eject Count instructs DOS as to the number of blank lines to be
output after each page. (A page is a set of lines equal in number
to the Depth count). If this byte is zero, no Eject lines are
output. Default=0.
</dd>
<dt>TTYSET Pause Control $CC09</dt>
<dd>
The Pause byte instructs DOS what action to take after each page is
output. A zero value indicates that the pause feature is enabled;
a non-zero value, pause is disabled. Default=$FF, pause disabled.
</dd>
<dt>TTYSET Escape Character $CC0A</dt>
<dd>
The Escape character causes DOS to pause after an output line.
Default=$1B, ASCII ESC.
<a href="flexuser.htm#ttyset">TTYSET DOS Utility</a>.
</dd>
<dt>System Drive Number $CC0B</dt>
<dd>
This is the number of the disk drive from which commands are

Default= drive #0.
</dd>
<dt>Working Drive Number $CC0C</dt>
<dd>
This is the number of the default disk drive referenced for
non-command files. If this byte is $FF, both drives 0 and 1 will
be searched. Default= drive #0.

for details.
</dd>
<dt>User Command Table Address $CC12-$CC13</dt>
<dd>
The programmer may store into these locations the address of a command table

<dd>
These two bytes contain the end of user memory. This location is set during
system boot and may be read by programs requiring this information.
</dd>
<dt>Error Name Vector $CC2D-$CC2E</dt>
<dd>
If these bytes are zero, the
<a href="flexdos.htm#rpterr">routine RPTERR</a>
will use the file ERRORS.SYS as
the error file. If they are non-zero, they are assumed to be the address of
an ASCII string of characters (in directory format) of the name of the file
to be used as the error file. See
