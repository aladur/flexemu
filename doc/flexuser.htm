<h2 id="commands">FLEX USER COMMANDS</h2>
<div class="options-list">
<dl>
<dt>GET[,&lt;filespec&gt;[,&lt;filespec&gt;]...]</dt>
<dd>
The
GET
command is used to load a binary file into memory. It is a special purpose
command and is not often used.
<dt>MON</dt>
<dd>
MON
is used to exit FLEX and return to the system monitor. FLEX can simply
re-entered after using the MON command, by typing:
g&nbsp;cd03
or
x.
<dt>APPEND,&lt;filespec&gt;[,&lt;filespec&gt;]...,&lt;filespec&gt;</dt>
<dd>
The
APPEND
command is used to append or concatenate two or more files,
creating a new file as the result. Any type of file may be appended but
it only makes sense to append files of the same type in most cases. If
appending binary files which have transfer addresses associated with
them, the transfer address of the last file of the list will be the
effective transfer address of the resultant file. All of the original
files will be left intact. The default file extension is .TXT
</dd>
<dt>ASN[,W=n][,S=m]</dt>
<dd>
The
ASN
command can be used to assign the actual system and working drive.
If specified
n
will be assigned as working drive and
m
will be assigned as system drive, where
n
and
m
can be digits between 0 and 3.
<dt>BUILD,&lt;filespec&gt;</dt>
<dd>
The
BUILD
command is provided for those desiring to create small text files quickly
(such as STARTUP files or EXEC files).
BUILD
prompts with an equals sign ('='). Text can be entered line by line. Only the
actual line can be edited by a backspace character. To finish text entry
type a pound sign ('#') immediately following the prompt. The default file
extension is .TXT
<dt>CAT[,&lt;drive list&gt;][,&lt;match list&gt;]</dt>
<dd>
The
CAT
command is used to display the FLEX disk file names in the directory on each
disk. The user may display selected files on one or multiple drives.
Wildcards are possible f. e.
CAT A.T
catalogs all files with a name beginning with A and an extension beginning
with T.
<dt>COPY,&lt;filespec&gt;,&lt;filespec&gt;</dt>
<dd>
<dt>COPY,&lt;filespec&gt;,&lt;drive&gt;</dt>
<dd>
<dt>COPY,&lt;drive&gt;,&lt;drive&gt;[,&lt;match list&gt;]</dt>
<dd>
The
COPY
command is used for making copies of files on a disk. Individual
files, groups of name-similar files or entire disks may be copied. &lt;match
list&gt; is the same as described in the CAT command.
<dt>DATE [,&lt;month&gt;,&lt;day&gt;,&lt;year&gt;]</dt>
<dd>
The
DATE
command is used to display or change an internal FLEX date register. Within
flexemu the date can be changed within FLEX but this will not change the
date of the host operating system. 
<dt>DELETE,&lt;filespec&gt;[,&lt;filespec&gt;]...</dt>
<dd>
The
DELETE
command is used to delete a file from the disk. Its name will be removed from
the directory and its sector space will be returned to the free space on the
disk.
<dt>EXEC,&lt;filespec&gt;</dt>
<dd>
The
EXEC
command is used to process a text file as a list of commands. The default file
extension is .TXT
<dt>GET,&lt;filespec&gt;</dt>
<dd>
The
GET
command can be used to read a binary file into memory but don't execute it. The
default file extension is .BIN
<dt>I,&lt;filespec&gt;,&lt;command&gt;</dt>
<dd>
The
I
command allows a utility to obtain input characters from a disk file rather
than the terminal. The default file extension is .TXT
<dt>JUMP,&lt;hex address&gt;</dt>
<dd>
The
JUMP
command is provided for convenience. It is used to start execution of a
program already in memory, f. e. loaded by a GET command.
<dt>LINK,&lt;filespec&gt;</dt>
<dd>
The
LINK command is used to tell the bootstrap loader where FLEX operating
system file resides on the disk. This is necessary each time a system disk
is created. It is NOT necessary if logging in a directory as system drive.
In this case the link will be dynamically generated. The default file
extension is .SYS
<dt>LIST,&lt;filespec&gt;[,&lt;line range&gt;[,&lt;+options&gt;]</dt>
<dd>
The
LIST
command is used to list the contents of text files on the terminal. It is
possible to list entire files or selected line ranges of the file. Following
options are possible:
<p>
<table>
 <tr><th>Option</th><th>Description</th></tr>
 <tr><td>+N<td>display line numbers</td></tr>
 <tr><td>+P<td>do page formatting</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
The default file extension is .TXT
<dt>O,&lt;filespec&gt;,&lt;command&gt;</dt>
<dd>
The
O
command can be used to route all displayed output from a utility to an
output file instead of the terminal. The default extension is .OUT
<dt>P,&lt;command&gt;</dt>
<dd>
The
P
command can be used to print the output of any command to the Printer.
Within flexemu no Printer is supported.
<dt>PROT,&lt;filespec&gt;,(option list)</dt>
<dd>
The
PROT
command is used to change a protection code associated with each file.
When a file is first saved, is has no protection associated with it thereby
allowing the user to write to, rename, or delete the file. Delete or write
protection can be added to a file by using the 
PROT
command. Following options are possible:
<p>
<table>
  <tr><th>Option</th><th>Description</th></tr>
  <tr><td>D<td>Delete protect a file</td></tr>
  <tr><td>W<td>Write protect a file</td></tr>
  <tr><td>C<td>Catalog protect a file</td></tr>
  <tr><td>X<td>Remove all protections from file</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
F. e.
PROT,CAT.CMD,XW
removes any previous protection on CAT.CMD and write
protects it.
<dt>QCHECK</dt>
<dd>
The
QCHECK
Utility can be used to examine the contents of the print queue and to modify
it's contents. Within flexemu no printing is supported.
<dt>RENAME,&lt;filespec1&gt;,&lt;filespec2&gt;</dt>
<dd>
The
RENAME
command is used to give an existing file a new name in the directory.
<dt id="save">SAVE,&lt;filespec&gt;,&lt;begin adr&gt;,&lt;end adr&gt;[,&lt;transfer adr&gt;]
<dd>
The
SAVE
command is used for saving a section of memory on the disk. The address fields
should be expressed as hex numbers. The default file extension is .BIN
<dt id="save_low">SAVE.LOW,&lt;filespec&gt;,&lt;begin adr&gt;,&lt;end adr&gt;[,&lt;transfer adr&gt;]
<dd>
Same as SAVE but SAVE.LOW itself is located in a lower memory area. With this
command it is possible to save programs located in the UCS area.
<dt id="startup">STARTUP
<dd>
STARTUP
is not a utility command but is a feature of FLEX. It is often desirable to have
the operating system do some special action or actions upon initialization
of the system (during the bootstrap loading process). As an example, the user
may always want to use BASIC immediately following the boot process. STARTUP
will allow for this without the necessity of calling the BASIC interpreter
each time.
<p>
FLEX always checks the disk's directory immediately following the system
initialization for a file called
STARTUP.TXT.
If none is found the system prompt
('+++') will be displayed. If a
STARTUP
file is present, it is read and interpreted as a single command line.
Several commands in one line can be separated by a end of line character.
<dt id="ttyset">TTYSET[,&lt;parameter list&gt;]
<dd>
The
TTYSET
utility command is provided so the user may control the characteristics of
the terminal. With this command, the action of the terminal on input and the
display format on output may be controlled. In the following parameter
specifications hh stands for one or two hex digits and dd stands for one or two
decimal digits.
<p>
following parameters (each separated by a comma) are supported:
<p>
<table>
 <tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Description</th></tr>
 <tr><th>BS=hh</th><td>Backspace character, default: Ctrl-H (hex 08) delete the
  last character typed from the terminal. Setting BS=0 will disable the
  backspace feature.</td></tr>
 <tr><th>BE=hh</th><td>Backspace echo character, default: 0. Defines the
  character to be sent to the terminal after a 'backspace' character is
  received.</td></tr>
 <tr><th>DL=hh</th><td>Delete character, default: Ctrl-X (hex 18) Erase the
  current input line. Set DL=0 will disable this feature.</td></tr>
 <tr><th>EL=hh</th><td>End of line character, default: colon (':'). With this
  character two commands can be separated on one input line. hh must be a
  printable character. Set EL=0 will disable this feature.
 <tr><th>DP=dd</th><td>Depth count, default: 0. Specifies the number of lines
  a page consists of. See also EJ and PS. Set DP=0 will disable this feature.
 <tr><th>WD=dd</th><td>Width, specifies the number of characters to be
  displayed on a physical line at the terminal (the number of columns).
 <tr><th>NL=dd</th><td>Null count, default: 4. Sets the number of non-printing
  (Null) 'pad' characters to be sent to the terminal at the end of each line.
 <tr><th>TB=hh</th><td>Tab character. This character is not used by FLEX but
  by some of the utilities f. e. a text editing system. This character should
  be set to a printable character.
 <tr><th>EJ=dd</th><td>Eject count, default: 0. Specifies the number of
  'eject lines' to be sent to the terminal at the bottom of each page. If
  EJ=0 no eject line will be sent.
 <tr><th>PS=Y|N</th><td>Pause control, default: N. Enables or disables the
  'end-of-page' feature. If Pause is on and DP is set to some nonzero value,
  the output display is automatically suspended at the end of each page. It
  may be continued by typing an 'escape' character.
 <tr><th>ES=hh</th><td>Escape character, default: hex 1B. The escape character
  is used to stop output from being displayed, and once it is stopped restart
  it again.
</table>
<p>
<dt>VERSION,&lt;filespec&gt;</dt>
<dd>
The
VERSION
utility is used to display the version number of a utility command. The
default extension is .CMD
<dt>VERIFY [,ON|,OFF]</dt>
<dd>
The
VERIFY
command is used to set the File Management System's write verification. If 
VERIFY
is on, every sector which is written to the disk is read back from the disk
for verification (to make sure there are no errors in any sectors). With
VERIFY
off, no verification is performed.
VERIFY
without any parameters displays it's current state. flexemu does NOT support
any verify operations.
<dt>XOUT[,&lt;drive spec&gt;]</dt>
<dd>
XOUT
is a special form of the delete command which deletes all files having
the extension .OUT.
</dl>
</div>

<h2 id="system">GENERAL SYSTEM INFORMATION</h2>
<div class="options-list">
<dl>
<dt>DISK CAPACITY</dt>
<dd>
Each sector of a FLEX disk contains 252 characters or bytes of user data (4
bytes of each 256 byte sector are used by the system). Thus a single-sided
mini disk has 340 sectors or 85,680 characters or bytes of user information.
A single-sided full size disk has 1140 sectors or 287,280 bytes of user data.
Doulbe-sided disks would contain exactly twice these amounts.
<dt>WRITE PROTECT</dt>
<dd>
Floppy disks can usually be physically write protected to prevent FLEX from
performing a write operation. Any attempt to write to such a disk will cause
an error message to be issued. It is good practice to write protect disks
which have important files on them.
<dt>THE SYSTEM-'RESET'</dt>
<dd>
The System-Reset should NEVER BE PRESSED DURING A DISK OPERATION. There should
never be a need to 'reset' the machine while in FLEX. If the machine is
entire disk will become damaged.
<dt>NOTES ON THE P COMMAND</dt>
<dd>
The P command tries to load a printer driver file named PRINT.SYS from the
same disk which P itself was retrieved. Within flexemu no printing is
supported yet.
